# Evil Dolphins

Delphinidae malum are a type of dolphin known for their wicked ways.

They were discovered during World War I by a group of french soldiers who proceeded to use them as weapons of war. The evil dolphins delight in unending torture of their victims made them perfect to decimate the enemy, however they were known to also kill the french soldiers if they were, as the dolphins described it, executed.

After World War I the use of Evil Dolphins was declared a war crime and the remaining dolphins were attempted to be destroyed, however some escaped and survived in hiding until they were rediscovered in 1992, when the CIA managed to inflitrate their final hidding place and destroy them. however the dolphins were able to escape to the internet and continue wreacking havoc to this day.

## How to deal with evil dolphins

An ancient script written by the romans indicates a ritual which can be used to banish the evil dolphins. This ritual exploits their use of something called a process to haunt their victims, this same process is their only weakness, if one destroys the process the dolphin created it will have no choice but to cease its evil. At least until it is reawakened by another.
